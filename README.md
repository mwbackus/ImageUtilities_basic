# Image Tools - Assignment 3

Project to base your assignment 3 off of. Do not modify the ImageUtils class I am providing to you. 
Instead, you should create a separate class that all your testing is done in.

The methods in which you will call are the public ones. These methods give the ability to load an image from file,
add an image to be displayed, display the images, and clone an array. You should not (and can not) call any of the
private methods. They are merely used as 'helper' methods for the others.

Included in this project is a standard test image for image processing, "src/LennaCV.png"

If you have any questions, my contact information is given in the ImageUtils.java file. If you choose to email me,
please put CS 110 of some form in the subject line, so I see your message and reply within a reasonable time frame.
